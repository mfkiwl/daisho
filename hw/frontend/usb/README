Hardware Notes
==============

Schematic and layout files were designed in KiCad (release 2014-09-15
bzr 5135 -product), an open source electronic design automation package.

Order and type of copper layers:
    1_top: signal, front ("component" side, where most components are mounted)
    2: ground plane
    3: signal
    4: signal
    5: ground plane
    6_bot: signal, back (a few components mounted, mostly small passives)

PCB description:

    6 layer PCB, 62 mil +/- 5% thickness, using 8 layer construction

    LPI mask          0.4 mil
    Plating           1.2 mil   1.0 oz
    Copper      1     0.7 mil   0.5 oz
    Dielectric  1-2   4.4 mil   prepreg, 2 x 106-FR4 370
    Copper      2     1.2 mil   1.0 oz
    Dielectric  2-3   6.0 mil   core, FR4 370
    Copper      3     1.2 mil   1.0 oz
    Dielectric  3-4   8.1 mil   prepreg, 3 x 1080-FR4 370
                3-4  14.5 mil   core, FR4 370
                3-4   8.1 mil   prepreg, 3 x 1080-FR4 370
    Copper      4     1.2 mil   1.0 oz
    Dielectric  4-5   6.0 mil   core, FR4 370
    Copper      5     1.2 mil   1.0 oz
    Dielectric  5-6   4.4 mil   prepreg, 2 x 106-FR4 370
    Copper      6     0.7 mil   0.5 oz
    Plating           1.2 mil   1.0 oz
    LPI mask          0.4 mil

Impedance Goals
===============

50 Ohm +/- 10% microstrip, layers 1:2 and 6:5 at 0.178 mm (7.0 mil) width

50 Ohm +/- 10% offset stripline, layers 3:2 and 4:5 at 0.165 mm (6.5 mil) width

90 Ohm +/- 10% differential microstrip, layers 1:2 and 6:5 at 0.127 mm (5.0 mil) width, 0.127 mm (5.0 mil) separation

Soldermask
==========

Double side solder mask green
    +/- 5 mil solder mask registration

Silkscreen
==========

Double side silkscreen white
    6 mil silkscreen minimum width
    Silkscreen must be clipped by soldermask

Traces
======

5 mil (0.127 mm) min trace width
5 mil (0.127 mm) min trace isolation

Vias
====

8 mil (0.2032 mm) min via drill
17.7 mil (0.45 mm) min via pad
    4.85 mil min annular ring

Via-in-pad used in many places

Vias in pads need to be filled for assembly
    Most (all?) vias in pads are in capacitor footprints near the two 175-BGAs

Drills
======

Drills are specified in two files:
    usb_drill.xln contains plated drills.
    usb_drill_npth.xln contains non-plated drills.
